1. The naming convention for pthread function calls is to start them with pthread_ 
http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/pthread/

2. mutexes, condition variables, read-write locks, and barriers
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html

3. It is a good idea to call pthread_cond_wait from a loop to ensure that it has woken under the 
correct conditions, ie not a spurious wake up, if not, it can return to a waiting state.

4. After a thread is woken, the thread that is able to obtain the mutex first is the one that is executed.

5. Holding multiple mutex when blocking on a conditional variable would result in one of the mutex
being held until the wait is complete. This could lead to undesired results such as deadlocks if all
other threads are waiting on that mutex.

6. A detached thread is one that does not join back to the parent thread. It's resources are released 
automatically upon exit.
